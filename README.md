# gfftobed
Convert GFF3 to BED



This program takes an input genome annotation in GFF3 format and converts specific features to a 6 column BED format. It is capable of extracting any type of feature and any attribute in GFF3 format. It may also work with annotations in GTF. However, the 9th column of the GTF will be put in the 4th column of the BED file.
